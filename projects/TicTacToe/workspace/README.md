Given the requirements, we will be using Node.js for the server side and Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. For the client side, we will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It will set up our server and handle socket events such as connection, disconnection, and game events.

2. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will be served to the client. It will contain the game board and the necessary scripts for handling user interaction and communication with the server.

3. `styles.css`: This file will contain all the CSS styles for our game.

4. `client.js`: This file will handle all the client-side logic, including user interaction and communication with the server.

5. `package.json`: This file will contain all the necessary dependencies for our project.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.js
